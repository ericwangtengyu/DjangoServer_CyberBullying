        <p>
          The purpose of this study is to understand what cyberbullying is and how it occurs. About 400 middle school students across Iowa will be invited to be part of this study. This study involves two activities.</p>
        <blockquote><h2>"Cyberbullying is a growing problem.  We need to know how cyberbullying occurs so we can stop it."</h2></blockquote>

        <h3 id="sec1">Activity 1</h3>
        <p>
          Each child will be asked to complete two surveys, one in Fall 2014 and another in Spring 2015.  The survey will ask about communicating online and experiences with bullying both online and offline.  Each survey will take about 15 minutes to complete, and may be taken online or by paper (and sent back in a self-addressed stamped envelope).
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="sec2">Activity 2</h3>
        <p>
          Children who use iPhones or Androids will be asked to participate in an observational part.  Children will install a software application to capture text messages and posts on Facebook and Twitter for five months.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="sec3">Compensation</h3>
        <p>
          Children and parents will be consented for participation, and they may choose to participate in only Activity 1 (survey activity). A child does not need to own an iPhone or Android smartphone to be in the first part of this study. Children will be paid $15 for completing each survey. Children in the smartphone observation activity will be paid $40 per month (total is $200 for 5 months) to cover approximate costs of a smartphone data plan.  Taking part in this research study is completely voluntary.</p>

                <p>
          Schools are critical partners in this project. We will work closely with schools in our recruitment efforts and look forward to speaking with staff and parents about the study. Results of this study will be shared with school staff, parents and children.
